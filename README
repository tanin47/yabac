Yet a better auto-complete (YABAC)
===================================

What is wrong with the classic jQuery auto-complete?
(http://jquery.bassistance.de/autocomplete/demo/)
----------------

The most annoying problem that I have found is that it does not filter the result immediately after user types.

Only when the ajax request is completed, the result list is updated.

For example,
When you type: do, it suggests "dog","does", and "done".
And then you type: doe, "dog", "does", and "done" are still shown briefly.

Actually, we can filter the results locally and show only the valid ones instead.

Introduction
--------------

YABAC is a simpler jQuery auto-complete library. It supports:

- caching, 
- posting extra parameters by constant and by function,
- templating the result (Handlebars.js required),
- differentiate between displaying text and value,
- manual positioning and sizing

Requirement
---------------
jQuery
Backbone.js
Handlebars.js
